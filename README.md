# School Online Examination Portal
### Overview of an Online Examination Portal:
    In this Fun Assignment, We challenged our-self to make a Portal where Student can give there Exams. You might wonder why us and what's Different in our project.
    Answer is we didn't just made a portal for Student to just have there exams and its purpose is fulfilled. In our Project we have implemented things which makes Handling Data which include Student, Teachers as well as Admin Easier. Via this Portal Admin of the School can manage many things rather then just Exams and their details. Admin can see and manage there Staff as well as student and Exam details. Teacher's can easily prepare paper for Student without having to hustle alot.

### Why Online Examination Portal? Why not something else?
    The answer is so simple yet difficult to answer. Since we are hit by pandemic and everyone was at there home and struggling with new situations. So we wanted to work on a project which can help small schools and Educational Firms to get benefit from that and Student can give there exam continently only while being safe at home.
